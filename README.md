# recipe-memo

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to allow users to add cooking instructions that they have created or read online into a repository so that they can come back and look at it without having to search it up again, or even try finding it somewhere in their notes app/paper. 

## Issue that it aims to solve

The main problem this app aims to address that most recipe websites do not allow you to edit the recipe to your liking, so every time you come back to the website, you might've forgotten what you did to make it meet your palette. 

By allowing users to take a copy of an online recipe and then adding the ability to edit to make it their own is a must need tool for any creative and organized chef.
